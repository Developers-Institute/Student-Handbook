## Introduction.

At Developers Institute our purpose is to use education and technology to transform people's lives.

### Vision
Our vision is to provide accessible, affordable and transformative vocational education, which leads to meaningful employment to build a more equitable society. We believe our purpose is to help people to realise and reach their full potential through education, training, jobs and encouraging growth in the technology sector in Northland.

## Fees, Withdrawal and Refund Policy.
### Fees Free Policy
From 1 January 2018, tertiary education will be fees-free for eligible first time tertiary students. Broadly, if you’re a New Zealander who finished school in 2017, or later, you may qualify for a year of fees-free provider-based tertiary education or two years of industry training in 2018.
If a prospective student is not a recent school leaver, and they have done less than half a year of education or training (including tertiary study in any other country), they may also qualify.

Students can find out whether they are eligible on the fees-free website, www.feesfree.govt.nz/ or discuss your options during your selection interview.

### Fees Refunded After Commencement of Full Time Paid Programme
If a student withdraws within the first eight days after commencement of a programme, a fee refund will be due. 
Note: If fees have not been paid to Developers Institute, a refund will not be given.
With effect from 2 June 2018, domestic students withdrawing from courses of less than three months duration are entitled to a refund, under section 235(1A) of the Education Act 1989.
Domestic students are entitled to a refund if they withdraw from a programme or training scheme as per section 235 of the Education Act 1989, and if: the course is of three months duration or more and the withdrawal occurs up to the end of the eighth (8) working day after the start of a course.
Formal withdrawal within the first eight (8) working days of the programme is confirmed by the completion and return of the Cancellation/Withdrawal Form to the Programme Coordinator. The Academic Director shall have been communicated with (by the Programme Coordinator) and signed off the form for the withdrawal to proceed. The date of withdrawal is deemed to be the date the student returns the signed Cancellation/Withdrawal form.
The Developers Institute will refund an amount equal to the sum of the amount paid. Any due refunds will be available within fourteen days of notice of withdrawal. 
Please see Student Refunds, Withdrawals and Fee Protection Policy for further information.

### Bad Debts
Where money is due to Developers Institute and not paid as due, or arrangements made and adhered to, Developers Institute reserves the right to refer debts to a Debt Collection Agency. If this occurs, all costs associated with debt collection will be added to the debt owed to Developers Institute.

### Fee Protection
All fees (eg: administration fees, accommodation fees, student fees, or student services costs) are to be paid directly into the Public Trust Standard Trust Account, however any fees that are paid to Developers Institute will be deposited into a Standard Trust Fee Protect account held by the Public Trust the following working day upon receiving the fees from the student. This arrangement has been accepted by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority as meeting the requirements of the Education Act 1989 and the Student Fee Protection Rules 2013.

Students will receive a copy of their ‘Fee Protect Student Acknowledgement Form’, which includes a ‘Payment Schedule’ showing how their student fees will be paid out to Developers Institute over the length of the programme they are enrolled in.

In the unlikely event of insolvency, regulatory or voluntary closure, student fee protection is assured to all Developers Institute students paying fees of over $500.00 and meets the requirements of NZQA. 

Students can view further information or access refunds of fees by contacting The Public Trust by calling 0800 494 733 or visiting www.publictrust.co.nz/fee-protect 
Note: Notices will be posted on the NZQA website (www.nzqa.govt.nz) regarding any meetings for students affected in the unlikely event of Developers Institute’s closure.

### Consumer Protection Mechanisms
Prior to Developers Institute being eligible to receive subsidies for student tuition, our accountants and auditors and the Ministry of Education’s accountants, rigorously check the financial status to ensure the student is not enrolling in an organisation that is financially unstable, and the Ministry of Education is not funding an organisation that is likely to go into liquidation or receivership.

Student fees are protected upon enrolment and payment of the programme fees. In the unlikely event of Developers Institute being forced into receivership or liquidation, the tuition fees will be protected under the Student Fee Protection Trust Account. The unused portion of tuition fees will be reimbursed to the student.

### Student Loans
Students should recognise this money is loaned to them to pay for their education. The fees loan, and programme related cost loan, is not for private use.
We ask that, having taken on this commitment, you put your best and ongoing effort into your education with us, to ensure you achieve your goals in education and employment. Developers Institute is committed to giving value for your investment in your future.
If you are unsure of anything loan related, please check with the Academic Director to ensure everything is correct.
Please note: If you don’t meet the course passing requirements you may not be able to get a student loan or allowance for any future study, unless it’s for reasons beyond your control (for example you’ve had something significant happen in your life which means you failed your course e.g. you had a serious illness etc).

### Delays
If any documentation is not correct for processing, delays will occur. We suggest you take the time to have another individual check your applications and retain copies in an attempt to avoid delays. 
Note: StudyLink, under the Ministry of Social Development, operates Student Loans and Allowances. The initial point of contact for applications can be done through the internet. http://www.studylink.govt.nz or phone 0800 88 99 00.

### Student Allowances
These are grants paid to students to cover living costs while in education at tertiary level. Applications for allowances must be obtained from StudyLink. We suggest you apply for your allowance six weeks before the commencement of your programme.  Ensure you reply promptly to any requests for further information. Note: This is a means-tested allowance. You will need to contact StudyLink regarding your eligibility.

### Living Costs Loan
This is extra student loan money that is available to assist with living costs during the programme. If a full student allowance is received, no living costs loan will be available to most students.

### Course Related Costs
You can claim course-related costs from StudyLink at any stage during your study if you're studying full-time.
Important information - Course-related costs are part of a Student Loan so you'll need to pay them back. If you're eligible, you can get a maximum of $1,000 every 52 weeks, it doesn't matter how many courses you're studying during this time.
Developers Institute supplies students with access to computers and software subscriptions which are included within the course fees.  There are no requirements for students to provide their own technology equipment unless they wish to do so.  Please see the Academic Director if you are planning to Bring Your Own Technology (BYOT).

## Student Feedback and Evaluation
We encourage student feedback and evaluation of our learning materials and teaching processes, to monitor and improve the quality of the student learning experience through the collection, use and reporting of this feedback.

We are continually reviewing all of our material, and record any feedback so that we can ensure our resources are relevant, correct and appropriate for each programme and the purpose they have in the current industry.  At the end of every assessment, there is an opportunity for students to provide feedback about their learning experience and to compete self-reflection activities.
 
Feedback processes are anonymous, systematic, rigorous and respectful of the rights of students and staff, and incorporate strategies to maximise student participation. Full privacy and confidentiality will be ensured at all stages of the process.

For every course, a Student Experience Questionnaire, Course Evaluation Questionnaire and Teaching Survey will be administered as well as a Programme Survey and Graduate Outcome Survey (for graduates only) which are administered annually. A set of questions is constructed and will form the basis of the survey deployed to systematically evaluate student experience at the Institute.

A range of other feedback mechanisms will be employed when appropriate including student representatives on the Programme Committee and Academic Board, focus group meetings and informal student comments. The digital suggestion box will be shared with students on commencement of programme.

All students will be provided with the opportunity to provide feedback in full confidence of anonymity.

Student Feedback will be used:
  -   to improve the quality of courses through the development of annual improvement plans;
  -   to inform the professional development needs of academic staff; to enhance course and unit design;
  -   to improve the provision of learning resources, facilities, equipment and services through the development of annual improvement plans;
  -   to compare and benchmark the Institute’s performance against the sector or other providers. 

The team at Developers Institute are committed to meeting student needs and ensuring ongoing success. You will also have the opportunity to provide feedback on your Tutor and the programme you attend during the year through the evaluation process.

Please see Developers Institute’s *Student Feedback Policy* available on the website for more information on Learner feedback and Evaluation.

## Academic Records and Privacy.
Students have the right to have their personal details protected and only given out to legitimate agencies for statistical and recording purposes. Make sure to let us know if any of your personal details change. This is so important, as we do not want you to miss out on any information that you are entitled to have.

## New Zealand Qualifications Authority.

### Expectations of Students
  - Students have signed a contract to accept Developers Institute rules.
  - Students are expected to attend their programme or work experience every day.
  - Students are expected to turn up on time.
  - If students are unable to get to work or to the course the student must phone the Developers Institute Administrator or contact the Tutor at least half an hour before the starting time.
  - If Developers Institute staff have not heard from a student they will be phoned every day, and home visited, until they let us know if they are returning.
  - If contact is not made within 5 working days a student will be given a written notification that they are likely to be withdrawn from the programme. If contact is not made during the following week after the receipt of the letter, the student will be withdrawn from the course and their student allowance or benefit will be affected.

### Attendance Policy
Students are required to attend all lectures, tutorials, practical classes, demonstrations, assessments and examinations required by the programme of study in which they are enrolled. Public Holidays are observed, with occasional availability to access campus for additional study time (this will be arranged on a case-by-case scenario). Some programmes have allocations for self-directed learning days for additional study and these will be advised by your Tutor.

Your Tutor will also ensure that you understand the correct start, finish and break times for the programme you are attending.  Students are required to be punctual for classes and to be present for the duration of the class.

Break times may vary from time to time, as the nature of the industry you are training for may require flexibility and this will be practiced while you are studying.

Students are required to attend the programme except under the following circumstances:
  - Illness - to be accompanied by a medical certificate after three days (a copy must be held on the student’s file).

If a student is unable to attend because of ill health or any other reason, they must have made contact with the Tutor or Academic Director no later than 9am.

Students must comply with the programme regulations for notification of absence due to illness or other circumstances as required for each course in which they are enrolled

These conditions apply to all students on a programme at Developers Institute:
  1.  Medical certificate must be supplied if a student is away sick for THREE or more days.
  2.  If consistently late starting in the mornings or back from breaks, this will result in a warning from the Tutor and noted in the additional notes on the students file.
  3.  If a student is absent for three consecutive days without any contact, the Tutor and/or Academic Director will try to make contact with the student by phone or home visit and arrange learning conversation.
  4.  If no contact is made, the Academic Director will send a letter to the student advising them that their Student Allowance will be affected if they do not make contact or return to the programme.
  5.  If there is no contact within 5 days of absence, the Academic Director will follow the withdrawal procedures 7.2 set out in the *Student Refunds, Withdrawals and Fee Protection Policy*. 
  6.  Once this process has been actioned, the Academic Director will contact StudyLink to advise them to cancel any payments the student is receiving as part of a student loan (Living Costs) or a student allowance. Work and Income and/or Youth Service will be notified if appropriate.
  7.  A minimum of 90% attendance is required as part of the criteria to achieve the graduation certificate for any fee paying programme. The 10% allowance is to allow for sick days or special circumstances leave.
  8.  If a student does not attend the first two weeks of a programme or course, the enrolment in that programme and/or course(s) will be cancelled unless the student enrols after the first two weeks of the programme (i.e. late enrolment).

### Disciplinary Procedure
Gross violation of the rules and regulations may result in a stand down period.
  1.  An oral warning will be issued stating the nature of the offence.
  2.  A written warning will be issued stating the nature of the offence.
  3.  The student will be required to leave the programme if the behaviour persists.

**Note**: In the case of persons under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the student will be asked to leave the programme immediately and the above dismissal procedure will follow.

Students who are suspended or expelled are not eligible for any refund of any fees of any balance of their qualification.

Please refer to the *Student Concerns, Complaints, Academic Appeals and Disciplinary Policy* for full information on the process and procedures regarding the Disciplinary Procedures.

### Health and Safety
Developers Institute will provide an environment which is safe for all students and staff.
  - Your first responsibility is to keep yourself safe.
  - Your second responsibility is to ensure that your actions do not endanger the safety of others.
  - Please inform your Tutor of any hazard you identify.
  - The First Aid resource person is your Tutor and then the Campus First Aid Officers. Your Tutor will tell you who they are.
  - First Aid resources and procedures will be explained by your Tutor.
  - If you have brought an approved guest on site, it is your responsibility to ensure they are aware of any hazards within the study environment

**All occupants must remain at the assembly point until the “all clear” is given by the fire service**.

Developers Institute will hold a trial evacuation once every term at each site.

### Equal Education Opportunities Policy
Developers Institute supports the principles of Equal Education Opportunities as a means of ensuring all students have equal opportunity to achieve their potential.

The company’s recruitment and promotion are designed to ensure equal opportunity for all individuals.

Programme entry criteria will be fair and consistent with those criteria set down by either the funding agency or the New Zealand Qualifications Authority.

There will be no discrimination on any of the following grounds: Gender, Marital status, Family status, Religion or belief, Colour, Race, Ethnic or national origin, Disability, Age, Political opinion, Employment status (i.e. Being unemployed or a beneficiary) or Sexual orientation

All employees of the organisation and students have a responsibility to act in a non-discriminatory manner. Those that fail to do so will be liable to appropriate disciplinary procedures.

Particular care must be exercised to comply with this policy in:
  - wording of all educational materials
  - selection processes for recruitment, promotion and training opportunities
  - design and development of programmes

The legislation relating to discrimination is contained in the *Human Rights Act 1993*.

## Assessment.
### Reassessment
(Also known as re-sit). An opportunity for a student to undertake an assessment task or activity a second time (or more) within the timing of the programme or course.  Re-sits and reassessments are carried out within the published timeline of the course. Course results usually are not published until after the resit/resubmission date. 
Any student who has scored below 50% on the assessment, or project may request one opportunity to resubmit their final assessment, or project. The Programme Committee will only allow one resubmission opportunity for an assessment item. The mark of a resubmission is capped at ceiling of 50% which equates to a C- grade. 

### Appeal of Assessment
Please follow the procedure outlined below for review or appeal of assessment.  Should you need to request an appeal or review, please use the Appeal of Assessment form provided on the next page. A digital submission can be made [here](https://developersinstitute349232.typeform.com/to/sf6qvB).

### Review and re-mark of Assessments
Any candidate who feels that an assessment decision that does not award them credit was incorrect, is entitled to have their assessment reviewed. The candidate’s request for the review should be emailed to admin@developersinstitute.ac.nz or by writing to:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Academic Director<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developers Institute Limited<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c/- The Orchard Business and Event Hub<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 1. 85 Cameron St<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whangārei. 0110<br>

The request must be received within 5 working days of receiving notification of the assessment decision. Reviews may be requested for a number of reasons including:
  - That the assessor did not recognise the candidate’s achievement of the required standard of performance.
  - That the assessor failed to follow proper and agreed assessment procedures.
  - The decision is different from the feedback received at the time of the assessment.

### Review Process
  1.  Students who wish to appeal the results of their assessments shall discuss their concerns with the Wellbeing Manager or Tutor first. 
  2.  If they are dissatisfied with the outcome of the discussion with the Wellbeing Manager or Tutor, then the student may appeal to the Academic Director in writing within five (5) days of receipt of the grade. 
  3.  The Academic Director’s decision shall be final.
  
For further information about Assessment appeals, re-sits, re-marks or recounts please refer to the following policies; the *Student Concerns, Complaints, Academic Appeals and Disciplinary Policy* and the *Student Monitoring Policy*, and the *Assessment Policy* - available upon request.

### Plagiarism and cheating
It is expected that all student work submitted is of their own.

Cheating - giving any fraudulent response, and Plagiarism - taking and using another’s work as one’s own without proper acknowledgment; is categorised as Academic misconduct. 
Where Academic misconduct is alleged evaluation and disciplinary procedures will be followed., severe penalties will be imposed for confirmed misconduct.
Developers Institute reserves the right to use electronic systems to detect academic misconduct. Students will be notified where such systems are in place.
For further information refer to *Academic Integrity Policy*, and the *Assessment Policy*.

## Assessment Appeal Form.

## Suggestions and Complaints.
A student may wish to offer a suggestion or complain about a decision, action or experience.  A suggestion can be uploaded anonymously to a digital suggestion box hosted by Typeform.

All complaints should be brought to the attention of Developers Institute in the first instance by following the procedures set out in the *Student Concerns, Complaints, Academic Appeals and Disciplinary Policy* available on the Developers Institute website: www.developersinstitute.ac.nz. 
Students must make every attempt to resolve any concerns they may have, at the earliest opportunity with those most directly involved within the programme or service area in which it originated.

Where the student wishes to make a complaint, they should follow the complaints process stating the nature of the complaint and outlining the steps already taken to address the issue. To ensure that complaints can be resolved effectively, a complaint must be lodged within 3 months of the event occurring.

The Chief Executive or nominee of the Chief Executive will investigate both sides and ultimately make a ruling. Note: The Chief Executive is ultimately responsible for that ruling.

If satisfaction is not reached using the internal procedure, then the complaint or suggestion may be taken further and the student can access an industry nominated representative. Details for the relevant representative are available from reception.

If a complaint is not resolved satisfactorily from the students perspective; A student may make a formal complaint to NZQA in writing about Developers Institute (the registered PTE) using the formal complaint form provided on the NZQA website.  Students must make a genuine effort to resolve their concerns by following the Developers Institute formal complaint process, before making a formal complaint to NZQA.
For further information about making a complaint and the formal complaints form - see the information on the NZQA website: 
https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/about-us/make-a-complaint/make-a-complaint-about-a-provider/.
If the complaint is still not resolved at this stage, Developers Institute is a member of the ITENZ Quality Commission Scheme and this offers students another option for resolving issues.
The scheme works like this:
  1.  If you have a complaint about any aspect of the service you have purchased from a provider, use the provider’s internal complaints process.
  2.  If you are not satisfied with the outcome of the internal complaints process – or are still deadlocked after two months – you can lodge a complaint with the Quality Commissioner.
  3.  The Commissioner decides whether this is the sort of complaint the scheme covers and what procedure to follow. If you have not followed the provider’s internal complaints process, the Commissioner will refer the complaint back to the provider.
  4.  Your provider is given full details of your complaint and is asked to respond.
  5.  Having considered your complaint, the Commissioner can promote a settlement between you and the provider.
  6.  If this does not work, the Commissioner can recommend a resolution, including a monetary settlement.
  7.  Settlements are full and final. If you accept the settlement you can not pursue other avenues.

How does the Quality Commission complaints service differ from other options students have?
The Quality Commissioner aims to resolve disputes individual students may have with a provider. Up until now students have had the option of;
  1.  Taking a complaint to the New Zealand Qualifications Authority if satisfaction is not found elsewhere.
  2.  Going to the source of Government funding.
  3.  Taking legal action.
These options are still available but now students have another alternative in the Quality Commission.

## Complaint Form.
This form is to be used where a student wishes to make an informal complaint about something affecting their study on any programme at Developers Institute.

If you do not use this form, please include the following information in your letter to assist Developers Institute to resolve your complaint. This form can be digitally submitted by following [this link](https://developersinstitute349232.typeform.com/to/lLiPNo). You may also request a hardcopy from the Administration team.
